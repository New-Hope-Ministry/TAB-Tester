            1. Local Storage - If you decide to let The Ark Bible store files locally, all the support files for the application will be stored locally in your browser cache as each page, such as this Help page is accessed. All the version files will be stored locally as you change Bible versions. The first time you use a Bible version listed in the Versions menu or open another page that is part of the app, it will require an internet connection. Once you have accessed a version or another page within the app for the first time, it will also be stored locally. Once stored all version and operational files required by the app will be stored locally with an active internet connection, it will be available offline for future use without an internet connection. After being saved locally the app will not require an internet connection, unless you try to access a version of the Bible that has not yet been saved locally, and it will operate much more efficiently. All of the functional files to make The Ark Bible operational requires approximately 90kb of local storage space. Each version of the Bible for The Ark Bible requires approximately 1.6MB of local storage space. If you went through the entire Versions menu and stored each of the versions locally, it would require approximately 110MB of local storage space. Each version is only stored once, and you must have an active internet connection the first time you access a version. If you decide not to allow files to be stored locally, the app will require an internet connection every time you run it. All this can be reset by either clicking the Reset Defaults link on the main page, or deleting your browser history, and all files will be deleted. If you want to use the app after clicking Reset Defaults or clearing the browser history, all files will have to be downloaded again. If you choose not to allow files to be stored locally, the app will require an internet connection, and all files will have to be downloaded each time the app is used, which will increase bandwidth transfer from the server. Storing the files locally will drastically reduce internet bandwidth usage, which will help spread God's word, because internet bandwidth can be expensive, so please help us spread God's word, and store files locally.

            4. The Red Letter - The Red Letter, Black Letter function is currently only available for the partially edited chapters in the Twenty-Fist Century Version of the Bible. Other chapters and versions will eventually be able to use this functionality also, but not today. The Red Letter - Black Letter button is not visible for this functionality for the other versions, so the disappearing funcitionality buttons are not an error.

            6. The Reset Defaults button resets the settings in the app back to the default settings. It also deletes any data stored on your device, and the next time you run the app it will ask you if you want to allow data to be stored locally. If you click cancel, nothing will be stored on your device. If you change your mind later and want to have access to the app offline, just click the Reset Defaults button, and restart you browser. If you have an internet connection you can choose to have the files stored on your device or not.

            8. The BibleAsk app is an AI(Artificial Intelligence) Bible research tool and chat bot. You can research the Bible, and have chats about the Bible with this app. This app is not affiliated with The Ark Bible, but I added this link because I thought it looked very promising.

               9. The speech synthesis functionality for The Ark Bible, currently works in a very inconsistant way, and funcionality can depend on the browser, and your device operating system. Currently it works best with the Microsoft Edge browser on Windows. It works with the Chrome browser, but I have had very inconsistant results with languages other than English in the Chrome Browser. Right now the Chrome browser seems to only work with the English language, even though the browser reports that it has other languages available. It may work with other systems that have the default system language set for languages other than English, but I do not have the ability to test it on other setups at this time. I hope it works for you, but right now the best I can promises, is that it "Kind Of Works!"

               10. The 365 Day Chronological Reading Plan is a feature of The Ark Bible that is now available. It is an arrangement of the Bible with the chapters listed in chronological order as they happened historically. The arrangement comes from a chronological list prepared by the Blue Letter Bible, which can be seen here.
